# hello-world

Hey there!

Ammon here. I am from a lovely country in Africa called Ghana, where the water is super fresh and the air tastes like
chicken soup! I'm almost insanely exited to be a part of this team, and learning web development has been a life-long dream.
hope to work well with you all.

Cheers!
